  <p>
Q: What do the buttons on the Home Page do?
</p>
<p>
A: The “Add” button allows you to add a new course by typing a name into the text box. You will then be taken to the course’s page after clicking on its name.
The green “Grade” button lets you toggle between “Running Grades” and “Total Grades,” which is addressed later in this FAQ. 
</p>
<p>
Q: What do the buttons within each Course Page do?
</p>
<p>
A: The “Home” icon at the upper left corner takes you back to the home page. 
The “Switch View” button lets you toggle between “Actual Grade” and “Predictive Grade,” which is explained in the next question.
The green “Grade” button lets you toggle between “Running Grade” and “Total Grade,” which is addressed later in this FAQ. 
The “Target Grade” button allows you to set your target grade in the class.
The “Add” button at the very bottom of the screen allows you to add a new section such as homework, quizzes, or tests and its weight in the course. You can click on the section to add items into it. 
The “Add” button within each section allows you to add an individual item as well as the score you received on it.
</p>
<p>
Q: What is predictive mode and why does it help me?
</p>
<p>
A: By switching to “Predictive Grade” within a course page, you gain the ability to change the scores of all the information you log. Additionally, you will be allowed to add and delete new sections or items for the course. Together, this allows you to predict what would happen in the course if you receive certain scores on different assignments. Keep in mind that when you revert back to “Actual Grade” all the changes made in “Predictive Grade” will be deleted.  
</p>
<p>
Q: What is the difference between Running Grade and Total Grade?
</p>
<p>
A: A running grade is a grade based on the weight of all the assignments that you have in currently, while a total grade is based off a 100% weighted scale. For example, let’s say you only have one section inputted called Homework, which is 10% of your grade. Let’s assume that, being the bright student you are, you have a 100% in Homework. For “Running Grade,” this would be processed as a “100%,” while for “Total Grade,” this would be processed as a “10%,” since although you have a 100% in homework, it’s only 10% of your grade.
</p>
<p>
Q: How do I delete a course, section, or item?
</p>
<p>
A: Simply swipe let on what you want to delete and click “Yes.”
